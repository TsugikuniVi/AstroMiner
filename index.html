            <br>
            <p class='text' >
            The Earth is aging and it’s becoming weak. Every second, crops can’t grow as the soil is losing its nutrients, and the gravitational pull of the earth and moon increases, 
            causing strong and destructive tides that affect the Earth’s landscape.

            <br>
            <p class='text' >
                AstroMiner is an AI that controls robots. These robots mine asteroids for valuable minerals like iron, metal, etc. which can be used for creating spaceships that can help humanity.

            <p class='text' >
                <ul>
                    <li>The robots controlled by AstroMiner use the Sun's energy by letting it bounce off inbuilt mirrors and condensing it to usable energy.</li>  
                    <li>This is a more efficient way of using Solar Energy because of the distance to the Sun compared to Earth. Thus, these robots use sustainable energy.</li>  
                    <li>The robots mine asteroids from the external part of the Asteroid Belt which is in between Mars and Jupiter.</li>  
                    <li>These Robots have storage units to store ores and minerals extracted from asteroids in them.  These storage units can carry very large amounts of ores.  After mining, they travel back to Earth to deposit the minerals.</li>   
                    <li>In Earth,  AstroMiner controls big pistons to create spaceships, for evacuating humans, under the supervision of a human with expertise in the field.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The robots will be made of 70% Tungsten and 30% Tantalum.</li>  
                    <li>The Robots will be made in China since China is the largest global supplier of Tungsten and Tantalum will be exported from Australia and Brazil.</li>  
                    <li>These Robots will be created by machines which are controlled by AstroMiner.  AstroMiner will create these robots under the supervision of an expert.</li>  
                    <li>Around 82 million robots can be made using the materials available in Earth, however, only around 100 robots and extras will be made, only if needed.</li>   
                    <li>A robot’s trip to gather materials will take around 14 months.</li>

            <h1>The Plan:</h1>
            <br>
            <p class='text'>
                The Spaceships created by AstroMiner can be used to evacuate humans, in case of any global threats, to Mars like;
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Asteroid impacts</em></li> 
                    <li><em>Solar flares</em></li> 
                    <li><em>Gamma-ray bursts</em></li> 
                    <li><em>Supernovae</em> </li> 
                    <li><em>Orbital debris</em></li> 
                    However, Mars may be still inhabitable during such a threat,  so we can resort to using a very big space station like AstroStride
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="planimg"><img src="imgs/plan.jpg" alt=""></div>

            <h1>AstroStride</h1>
            <br>
            <p class='text' >
                AstroStride, a set of space stations, created by AstroMiner is a last resort in case of any threats. They are made of very strong metals that can withstand the stresses of spaceflight. 
                <br>
                It can travel around with millions of people inside it.  It is extremely habitable.
                <br>
                <br>
                AstroStride is made up of the following materials:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Metals: The spacecraft would likely be constructed from a variety of metals, including aluminum, titanium, and steel.</li> 
                <br>
                <li>Composites:  Advanced composites such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) might also be used in the construction of the spacecraft. These materials are known for their strength, stiffness, and lightweight properties, which would help to reduce the overall weight of the spacecraft.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Ceramics:  Ceramic materials might be used in the construction of heat shields and other components that need to withstand high temperatures. Materials such as silicon carbide and alumina have been used in spacecraft applications in the past due to their excellent thermal properties.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Plastics:  Various plastics and polymers might be used in the construction of the spacecraft's interior components, such as the walls, floors, and ceilings.</li>
                </ul>
